## Usage
For saving the running programs and its workspace disposition run the given command:
```bash
sway-session save
```
It will create a json file at `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sway-session/sessions/`.

To restore simply use:
```bash
sway-session restore
```
The recomendation would be to place at the sway config file something like that:
```config
exec sway-session restore
```

There is a command for constantly save your session:
```bash
sway-session save-loop 120
```
It will save your session every 2 minutes, informed in seconds. If the seconds are not informed it will assume the default value, which is 1 minute.

As the recommended configuration for restore, the same is possible for it:
```config
exec sway-session save-loop
```

## Supported programs
Considering that a lot of programs have different ways of retrieving it state and restoring it to the desired state,
the `sway-session` can only offer a generic approach for all the ecosystem and for more specific programs (like terminal-emulators)
to offer some rules with more capabilities.
